# Degree Audit Parser
Developed during the 2024 OSU Hackathon, try it out at: https://degreeauditparse.kyle-white.com/

We were dissatisfied with Ohio State's degree audit format. It lacked specific course details, prerequisites for each course, and had a poor user interface. To address this, we created the 'Degree Audit Parser,' a modern and user-friendly tool designed to make OSU students' lives easier.

<div><strong>How It Works</strong></div>
We request an .html version of the user's degree audit, then parse the data into categories and subcategories of courses. This data is then used with the Class Search API (classes.osu.edu) to retrieve course titles, details, and prerequisites.
